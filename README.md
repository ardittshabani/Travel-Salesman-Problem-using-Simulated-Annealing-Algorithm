1   Introduction
The Traveling Salesman wants to visit each of the set of cities exactly once, starting from and returning to his home city. The problem is to find the shortest road path for this trip. The TSP problem is part of the NP-hard problems which are problematic to solve and computationally challenging as the number of the cities increases.
TSP has application in logistic, supply chain management, circuit design and operations research. Efficient solutions can optimize delivery routes, reduce operational costs, and improve performance in scheduling and resource allocation. 
The main objectives of this project are to implement the Simulated Annealing algorithm to solve the TSP, analyze its effectiveness in obtaining near-optimal solutions, and compare its computational efficiency with traditional approaches.
